# ============================================
# GitLab CI Pipeline for Terraform Data Mesh
# ============================================
# This pipeline follows the design document and reference pipeline patterns
# - CI runs on Pull Requests (plan only)
# - CD runs on merge to branch (apply)
# - Branch-based environments: dev, staging, production
# ============================================
